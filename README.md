My MVPs for this project were:
-------------------------------------------

1. Create a Pong base game.
- a paddle for each side and a ball that moves
- basic physics implementation for the ball movement
- implement a rule where if the ball hits your side, you lose
- score counter

2. Create an AI Base:
- knows how to hit the ball back
- knows how to not lose
- knows how to win
-------------------------------------------

My Bonus features were:
-------------------------------------------

1. Ball manipulation techniques
2. A basic machine learning AI that learns to keep up with the current AI
